## Oh Hell!
- The official rules can be found here: `https://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html`. 
- Our variation of "Oh Hell!" has the following rules:
    1. In the interest of time, we start with 1 card and go up to the max number of cards possible, but do not go back down to 1.
    2. Cards can be dealt in any way the dealer chooses. The dealer is the one who leads the round. The dealer rotates clockwise.
    3. A player who leads a trick cannot be the one to "break" the trump suit, they can only lead with the trump suit if someone else has played it earlier in the round.
    4. Guessing correctly awards a minimum of 20 points, with every trick you win granting you 10 more points. Guessing that you'll win 0 tricks = 20 points, 1 trick = 30 points, 2 tricks = 40 points, etc.
    5. You lose 10 points for how ever many tricks your guess was off by - guessing 2 tricks and winning 0 (or 4) would mean a loss 20 points. But guessing 2 and winning 1 (or 3) would mean a loss of 10 points.
